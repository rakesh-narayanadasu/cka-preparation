# Monitor Cluster Components

Effectively monitoring a Kubernetes cluster involves tracking metrics at both the node and pod levels.

For nodes, consider monitoring the following:

- Total number of nodes in the cluster
- Health status of each node
- Performance metrics such as CPU, memory, network, and disk utilization

For pods, focus on:

- The number of running pods
- CPU and memory consumption for every pod

Because Kubernetes does not include a comprehensive built-in monitoring solution, you must implement an external tool. Popular open-source monitoring solutions include Metrics Server, Prometheus, and Elastic Stack. In addition, proprietary options like Datadog and Dynatrace are available for more advanced use cases.

# Metrics Server

Metrics Server is designed to be deployed once per Kubernetes cluster. It collects metrics from nodes and pods, aggregates the data, and retains it in memory. **Keep in mind that because Metrics Server stores data only in memory, it does not support historical performance data**. For long-term metrics, consider integrating more advanced monitoring solutions.

Metrics Server is ideal for short-term monitoring and quick insights but is not meant for prolonged historical data analysis. For in-depth analytics, look into integrating Prometheus or Elastic Stack.

### How Metrics are Collected

Every Kubernetes node runs a service called the Kubelet, which communicates with the Kubernetes API server and manages pod operations. Within the Kubelet, an integrated component called cAdvisor (Container Advisor) is responsible for collecting performance metrics from running pods. These metrics are then exposed via the Kubelet API and retrieved by Metrics Server.

#### Deploying Metrics Server

Deploy Metrics Server by cloning the GitHub repository and applying its deployment files:
```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
kubectl create -f deploy/1.8+/
```

After executing these commands, you should see confirmation that various Kubernetes objects (such as ClusterRoleBinding, RoleBinding, APIService, ServiceAccount, Deployment, Service, and ClusterRole) have been created successfully. Allow the Metrics Server a few moments to begin collecting data from the nodes.

Once Metrics Server is active, you can check resource consumption on nodes with this command:
```
kubectl top node
```

To check performance metrics for pods, run:
```
kubectl top pod
```
